This site is a "cloud" sharing site for code and documentation that does 
not belong one of my specific GitHub project sites, but are either just 
standalone opensource code or info. files that I've opted to make freely 
available to anyone interested.  You are free to download any file from this 
site subject to the following LICENSE (see below).  The other use for this site 
is that I often need to file attachments to "issues" or "comments" on other 
GitHub projects for which GitHub does not currently allow "attachments" to be 
uploaded, so instead I'll upload here and provide a link in my comments to 
allow the project leader(s) to access them.  I attest that I have sole 
ownership of and the right to share these any and all of these files.
