Tk/Button.pm and Tk/Menubutton.pm:

I modified these many years ago to facilitate the auto-binding of 
[Alt-[key_letter]] bindings in their toplevel window parents when either a 
tilde ("~" appears before a letter in the button's/menubutton's text or the 
button's/menubutton's "-underline" option is used.  Apparently Tk does NOT 
do this automatically and without these changes, the app.-writer must add 
these bindings manually in the code for each button/menubutton with a 
specified shortcut letter to make the shortcuts work.  See my comments in the 
code!

Tk/Listbox.pm and Tk/HList.pm

I do not like many of the default mouse & keyboard bindings for the various 
"-selectmode" modes, namely "browse" and "extended", which seem archaic to me, 
so I made the behaviour more modern, consistant & useful.  Both these two 
modules work normally by default.  To use my alternate bindings, one need only 
to export the environment variable "jwtlistboxhack" set to "1".  This will use 
my alternate bindings for Listboxes, HLists, and some of my other Perl/Tk 
modules available on CPAN that work with lists and dropdowns.

I implemented this as sort of a hidden "easter-egg" such that other users are 
not affected (unless they set this environment variable).  These 2 modules, 
however come with Perl/Tk and so you'll need these modified versions in order 
to take advantage of this "easter-egg!"

There are numerous changes, so you will likely wish to just try it out.  One 
of the more major changes for example (in -selectmode => "extended") eliminates 
clearing of the selection using the mouse (or spacebar) to select additional 
non-contiguous items allowing user to easily select / deselect items one-at-a-
time without keyboard modifiers or dragging to select additional items 
contiguously.  Another, related, is that using [Alt-[mousebutton-1] WILL clear 
the selection and select just the item clicked on.

To use any of these modules, first rename the original Tk-installed versions to 
something like "[Modulename].pm.usesite_perl" and download and place it's 
corresponding replacement in /usr/local/lib/site_perl/Tk/.  NOTE:  You'll need 
to delete or rename the Tk-installed versions again whenever you upgrade 
Perl/Tk!  It's also a good idea to check here for upgrades whenever upgrading 
Perl/Tk in case we've found and incorporated some differences in their 
versions into these!  Also, be sure to set the "jwtlistboxhack" easter-egg if 
using these *List* modules, otherwise, there's not much point in installing 
those.

Enjoy a better Perl/Tk!
